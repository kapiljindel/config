## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Add Your Icon Assets

Add your `.png` icon files inside the following directory: android/app/src/main/res/drawable/

For example:
icon1.png
icon2.png
icon3.png


> ‚úÖ Icons must follow Android‚Äôs resolution requirements (e.g., 48x48dp or higher).

### 2. Update `AndroidManifest.xml`

Navigate to: android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml


And set the default app icon:

```xml
<application android:icon="@drawable/icon1" android:label="YourAppName"  ... >
```
### 3. Update Package Name in MainActivity.kt
```
Navigate to: android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/yourcompany/yourapp/MainActivity.kt

And update the package declaration at the top:
package com.yourcompany.yourapp

Make sure this matches your app‚Äôs actual package name.

```
### 4. Switch Icons in Flutter Page (UI Logic)

Create a UI screen in Flutter where the user can choose which icon to use.

You'll need to use Platform Channels or native Kotlin code to apply the selected icon dynamically.

‚ùó Changing app icons dynamically without restarting the app requires native implementation on Android only. iOS does not support it without user prompt.
